    <p>
      I am a Fine Art Graduate with experience working across a range of media including video, photography, mosaic,
      printmaking, painting and creative writing. I have a strong interest in promoting emotional and psychological
      well-being and fully recognise and champion the invaluable role that nature and creativity play in maintaining
      positive health and mental well-being. I am open to embracing a huge variety of forms of creative expression, not
      limited to just the visual arts, but enthusiastically participating in and advocating practices outside my
      professional training including dance, singing, writing, music and drama.
    </p>

    <p>
      I approach art in the same way that I approach life, with a constant curiosity and a propensity to see beauty with
      the mundane. I enjoy spending time outdoors in nature and connecting with others within local parks, community
      woodlands, agricultural land and nearby nature reserves. I firmly believe that you don’t have to go far to have an
      adventure, it’s all about perspective and mindset.

      I have always enjoyed writing, drawing and photography and, after initially starting Medical training at the
      University of Wales College of Medicine in Cardiff upon leaving school in 2000, I ultimately took a radical change
      in direction, breaking away from a science route and pursuing a creative avenue in the form of an Art Foundation
      Course at Warwickshire College in 2004. This course offered what felt like an indulgent opportunity to immerse
      myself in a range of media, from print-making to video art, drawing to photography, installation to sculpture. I
      dabbled in a number of materials and developed a particular interest in working with light.
    </p>

    <p>
      I found working in a conventional white space in a communal studio unappealing and problematic as I felt overly
      exposed and vulnerable to others’ judgement when pursuing a very deep, authentic exploration of my experience of
      the world. In order to truly play with techniques and materials and explore the possibilities before me, I needed
      to feel free and safe to make mistakes whilst experimenting and not be stymied by the observation of others.
      Consequently, I retreated to a dark space, quite literally a small room without windows and a door, that annexed
      onto the larger communal studio. This space enabled me to feel safe, hidden from view I could explore confidently,
      and it necessitated that I work with light as my medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      My exploration of light as a phenomenon extended into my studies at degree level, where I constructed a dedicated
      dark space where I could experiment freely without concern for others’ perceptions or intervention. My practice
      predominantly entailed digital and analogue photography, video, performance and projection. I toyed with the
      boundaries between light and dark and explored the interaction of projected light with materials of varying
      opacities, textures and colours.
    </p>

      Following graduation, I have continued my artistic journey and went on to develop an interest in mosaics. Mosaic
      is an incredibly alluring medium, it is highly tactile and enduring and ties together many elements from my
      artistic studies: the flow of the tesserae (andamento) references the mark- making and lines of drawing; the range
      and combination of textures and translucency can be manipulated to achieve a range of effects in a similar way to
      collage and presents an opportunity to play with light.
    </p>

    <p>
      After connecting and training with many mosaic artists in the UK including Sonia King, Mia Tavonatti, Catherine
      Parkinson and Sue Rew, I then turned my attentions abroad and to the capital of mosaic heritage sites, Ravenna,
      Italy, where I was taught by Master Mosaicist Luciana Notturni. When I returned from Italy, I assisted Aidan Hart
      (Iconographer and Mosaic Artist) with the production of a Venetian glass panel for an orthodox church in Houston,
      Texas using the double direct method I had learnt in Ravenna. I also assisted Gary Bricknell (owner of The Mosaic
      Restoration Company) in the installation of a mosaic design onto the arched ceiling of the Chapel of St. George
      and the English Martyrs at Westminster Cathedral.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having undertaken training in a range of methods of mosaic-making, I love playing with the medium; contemporary
      mosaic art is so versatile. I am keen to continue developing my mosaic vocabulary; the possibilities in terms of
      materials that can be incorporated into mosaic is endless! I am someone who is generally quite an extravert, I
      enjoy meeting and connecting with others and struggle to sit still, but with mosaic art I have discovered an
      absorbing art form that has a definite meditative quality. You can completely lose yourself in the intense
      concentration required when creating a mosaic. It is a highly tactile medium and requires considerable patience
      and skill to shape the tesserae and translate a two-dimensional design into a ‘fragmented whole.’ Both producing
      mosaics and letting my eye wander over a finished piece, present me with a welcome opportunity for quiet
      reflection in what can be a frenetic, fast-paced world.
    </p>

      After a foray into mosaic-making that started in 2012, I am pleased that 2020 has brought me back to (and reminded
      me of my love of) photography and video art, with a collaboration (my first one) with a good friend and talented
      singer-songwriter, Jill Davis. It’s a welcome return to working with light, this time capturing a beautiful
      sunrise, a tricky thing in a cloudy December. I’ve had the opportunity to explore my home county with fresh eyes,
      looking for good East-facing elevated locations in Warwickshire, I’ve enjoyed laughter and map-reading with a good
      friend and fellow creative and had my first experience of recording vocals in a professional sound studio. What’s
      next?...
